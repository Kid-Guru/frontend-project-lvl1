## About The Project
Brain Games is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile brain-boosting apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game and offer to play it again. 

List of games:
- Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated.
- Progression. Finds missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
- Definition of an even number.
- Determination of the greatest common factor.
- Definition of a prime number.
